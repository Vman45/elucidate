# elucidate.sh

An easy-to-use, easy-to-edit Bash script to build and install Enlightenment 24 on **Ubuntu Focal Fossa** :kiss:

## Get started

First, clone this repository (you need the *git* command installed):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/batden/elucidate.git .elucidate
```

This creates a new hidden folder named ".elucidate" in your home directory.

Please copy the file "elucidate.sh" from this new folder to the download folder.

Now change to the download folder and make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x elucidate.sh
```

Then issue the following command:

```bash
./elucidate.sh
```

On subsequent runs, open Terminal and simply type:

```bash
elucidate.sh
```
(Use tab completion: Just type *eluc* and press Tab)

### Update local repository

Be sure to check for updates at least once a week.
In order to do this,change to ~/.elucidate/ and run:

```bash
git pull
```

That's it.

Mind the cows! :cow2: :cow2: :cow2:
